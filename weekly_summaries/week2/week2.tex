Robert Love, in his detailed book \textit{Linux Kernel Development} (2010), introduces his readers to the structure and implementation of the Linux Kernel.
In chapters three and four, Love explains the fundamental unit of work in the Kernel, known as the process, as well as how processes are scheduled.
Scheduling is such an important part of the kernel that the author must explain it  in order to move on to more complex topics.
Love establishes himself as a knowledgeable teacher who can explain the most complicated details of the Kernel to his audience.
