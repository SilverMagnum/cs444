# Assignment 1

## Build Instructions
Fairly standard. The resulting executable will be named `producer-consumer`.

```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./producer-consumer
```

## Build Debug Target

```
$ ./configure
$ make debug
$ ./producer-consumer
```

## Cleanup

Cleanup should be completed between creating debug and production builds and
vice versa.

```
$ make clean
```

## Plagiarism

Please feel free to take a look at my code, but do not copy it into your own
academic projects or simply re-type it up without significant changes. I will
report suspected cases of plagiarism to the appropriate professor without
notice.
